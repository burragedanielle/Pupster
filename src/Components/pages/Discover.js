// `/discover`: This page displays a photo of a random dog retrieved from the [Dog Ceo API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/). 
//This page contains 2 clickable buttons: one for passing or "thumbs-downing" a dog, and one for picking or "thumbs-upping" a dog.
// When either button is clicked, a new dog image is loaded from the API. If you "thumbs up"
// a dog, there is a 1 in 5 chance that the dog likes you too, and the friends count goes up by 1.
